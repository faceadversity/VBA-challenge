# Stock Analysis with VBA

The objective of this project is to create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

* The ticker symbol
* Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
* The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of any given year to the closing price at the end of that year
* The total stock volume of the stock.

# The Yearly Stock Performance Results for 2018

# The Yearly Stock Performance Results for 2019
(already attached in the repo)

# The Yearly Stock Performance Results for 2020
(already attached in the repo)

Functionality was added to the VBA code that returned stock values with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". Each VBA script will have to be run individually to output the needed results in their corresponding yearly stock returns spreadsheet. The VBA files needed to perform this function is attached to the repository for reference purposes. A sample VBA code for the 2018 Stock Performance is included below:
